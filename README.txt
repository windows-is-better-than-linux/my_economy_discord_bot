This Discord bot is meticulously designed around a singular, overarching theme: a simulated economy.

Currently, my development roadmap includes the integration of various features such as virtual items, shops, banking systems, and numerous additional enhancements. However, these implementations are presently beyond reach as I continue to assimilate the complex concepts underpinning my plans.

Additionally, it is important to clarify that the data.json file currently contains only my user ID. Upon invocation of the "add_me" function, the ID of the command's author will be appended accordingly.

In conclusion, this project is poised for substantial growth over time. Therefore, I seek your assistance to collaboratively develop and elevate this initiative into an exemplary endeavor.
